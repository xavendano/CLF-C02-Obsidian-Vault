AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) Certification Topics - FREE VERSION - Obsidian Vault

# If you're reading this, you're closer to your certification!

This material is designed so that you can take it and fully own it. It is a knowledge base in the form of an Obsidian vault with **around 70 files in English**, with the topics related to the **AWS Cloud Practitioner Essential (CLF-C02) certification**, so that you can take this vault, explore it and customize it to your needs, tastes and your own understanding. 

The main idea is that this preloaded Second Brain is that you can turn it into an extension of your own brain, generating your own insights and leading you to improve your study process, understanding and organization in the certification.

In other words, it's a big push that will take you many steps forward...

**Q: Does this material guarantee me 100% that I will pass the certification?**

A: Let me be perfectly clear on this point. I can guarantee you that **if you don't study it is impossible for you to pass the exam.** That is to say, the purpose of this material is to make things easier for you, taking you several steps further (and many hours, believe me) in the construction of a second brain pre-loaded with the specific topics of this certification according to SkillBuilder in the form of a vault of obsidian, so that later you can take it, configure it and make your study and preparation process much more orderly and fluid.

**Q:Does it include exams or test questions?**

A: No. Here you will not find mock exams or similar, but if you take a look at the internet there are platforms that sell mock exams, but there are Youtubers who have dedicated a lot of time to preparing content about it.

**Q: Okay I understand, so this material replaces the official AWS material?**

A: **Whatttt?? No no no.** This Obsidian vault only contains some of the the topics (FREE VERSION) that are related to obtaining that certification with a very brief summary of each topic. But all the official information that you must consult to understand any details, delve deeper into the topics or have a greater understanding, is available in **the official AWS Website.**

**Q: Are all the important points relating to this particular certification contained in this vault?**

A: No, this **FREE VERSION** contains just a bit of information from the first 3 modules of the official AWS course.

**Q: Is there a Spanish version available?**

A: I'm on it. I hope to release it soon.

**Q: Where can I find the full version?**

A: Right here: Obsidian Vault: AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials (CLF-C02) Certification Topics (+300 files)
